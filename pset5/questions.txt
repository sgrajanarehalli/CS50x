0.  pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis 
is the longest English word in a dictionary. 
It is a coined term for a pneumoconiosis caused by 
inhalation of very fine silicate or quartz dust.

1.  getrusage returns resource usage measures for the calling 
process, the children of the calling process, or a single 
calling thread.
2.  There are 16 members in a variable of type struct rusage.
3.  Passing before and after by reference allows us to store the return value of getrusage to the address of before or after.
4.  the main function in speller.c individually scans each letter from the text using fgetc
allowing it to ignore words that contain invalid characters such as numbers. If a word contains a valid letter, 
the letter is appended to a char array and the index increases by 1. This continues until a space, tab 
or newline occurs. If an invalid character is encountered, the index is reset to 0 and the rest of 
the string is consumed.
5.  Relying on fscanf alone would not allow the program to filter out invallid characters.
6.  The parameters were declared as constants to prevent their values from being changed by the function.
7.  The program implements a hashtable of size [8192]. 
Each struct node contains a word (stored as a char array)
and a node*pointer. The word contained in the node is hashed
and stored in the array. In the case of a collision, the new
node will append to the linked list at the hashed index.
8.  The first time the code worked correctly, the runtime was .68 seconds
9.  Choosing a fast hash function improved the speed greatly. In 
addition, optimizing the size of the array to reduce the linear 
search time improved the speed of the program.
10. I was unable to decrease load time below 5 seconds.
